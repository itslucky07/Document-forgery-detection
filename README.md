 # Document Forgery Detection System
🚀 An advanced AI-driven system leveraging OCR, NLP, and machine learning to detect document fraud with high accuracy and efficiency.

# 🔍 Overview
This project is designed to detect and prevent document forgery across government-issued IDs (Aadhaar, PAN card) and financial records. Using a combination of Optical Character Recognition (OCR), Natural Language Processing (NLP), and Machine Learning, the system identifies inconsistencies, visual tampering, and transactional irregularities in real-time.

# 🛠 Features
✅ High-Accuracy OCR (92.1%) – Extracts text and structural data efficiently
✅ Machine Learning Detection – CNNs & Isolation Forests detect visual & data anomalies
✅ Security Feature Verification – Detects watermarks, holograms, and altered fonts
✅ Financial Fraud Analysis – Transaction pattern analysis, balance verification
✅ Real-Time Processing (115ms/document) – Swift anomaly alerts & fraud detection
✅ Automated Data Masking – Protects sensitive information (e.g., Aadhaar numbers)
✅ Multi-Language Support – Works with 200+ languages and various document formats
✅ Continuous Learning – Adapts to emerging fraud techniques

# ⚙️ Technologies Used
Programming Languages: Python

Libraries & Frameworks: OpenCV, Tesseract OCR, TensorFlow, Scikit-learn, Spacy, NLTK
